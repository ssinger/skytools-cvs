2007-12-xx  -  SkyTools 2.1.6  -  ""

    * Fix 'londiste provider seqs'
    * Include upgrade scripts in .tgz

2007-11-19  -  SkyTools 2.1.5  -  "Enterprise-Grade Duct Tape"

    = Big changes =

    * Lot of new docs [Dimitri Fontaine, Asko Oja, Marko Kreen]
    * Support for fkey and trigger handling in Londiste.  [Erik Jones]
    * Rewrite pgq.insert_event() and log triggers in C, thus SkyTools does
      not depend on PL/Python anymore.

    = Small changes =

    * pgq+txid: convert to new API appearing in 8.3 /contrib/txid/
    * Support psycopg2, preferring it to psycopg1.
    * Improved bulk_loader, using temp tables exclusively.
    * skytools.config: API change to allow usage without config file.
    * skytools module: quote_ident(), quote_fqident()
    * install .sql files under share/skytools in addition to contrib/
    * pgqadm: also vacuums londiste and pgq_ext tables, if they exist
    * londiste: provider add/remove --all [Hans-Juergen Schoenig]
    * backend modules support 8.3
    * pgq: switch pgq_lazy_fetch=NROWS for pgq.Consumer, which makes it use
      cursor for event fetching, thus allowing larger batches
    * txid: use bsearch() for larger snapshots

    = Fixes =

    * londiste fkeys: look also at dependers not only dependencies.
    * pgq.consumer: make queue seeking in case of failover more strict.
    * scriptmgr: dont die on user error.
    * pgq: there was still fallout from reorg - 2 missing indexes.
    * Due to historical reasons SerialConsumer (and thus Londiste)
      accessed completed tick table directly, not via functions.
      Make it use functions again.
    * londiste: set client_encoding on subscriber same as on provider
    * londiste: remove tbl should work also if table is already dropped [Dimitri Fontaine]
    * couple walmgr fixed [Martin Pihlak]

    = Upgrade procedure for database code =

    * PgQ (used on Londiste provider side), table structure, plpgsql functions:

        $ psql dbname -f upgrade/final/v2.1.5.pgq_core.sql

    * PgQ new insert_event(), written in C:

        $ psql dbname -f sql/pgq/lowlevel/pgq_lowlevel.sql

    * PgQ new triggers (sqltriga, logtriga, logutriga), written in C:

        $ psql dbname -f sql/pgq/triggers/pgq_triggers.sql

    * Londiste (both provider and subscriber side)

        $ psql dbname -f upgrade/final/v2.1.5.londiste.sql

    * pgq_ext:

        $ psql dbname -f upgrade/final/v2.1.5.pgq_ext.sql


2007-04-16  -  SkyTools 2.1.4  -  "Sweets from last Christmas"

    = Fixes =

    * logtriga.c was supposed to survive mismatched column string,
      but the logic were buggy.  Thanks go to Dmitriy V'jukov for
      good analysis.
    * Couple of scripts were not converted to new API.  Fix it.
    * Quiet a warning in textbuf.c
    * Make configure and Makefiles survive on BSD's where 'make'
      is not GNU make.  Thanks to Hans-Juergen Schoening.

    = Features =

    * Published WalMgr was an old version.  Sync with internal code,
      where Martin has done lot of enhancements.
    * Small incompat change in PGQ: add fields to pgq.get_consumer_info()
      return type.  Example upgrade procedure:

          DROP TYPE pgq.ret_consumer_info cascade;
	  \i structure/types.sql
	  \i functions/pgq.get_consumer_info.sql

      It will show some errors but thats ok.  Its annoying but needed
      for the tick_id cleanup in SerialConsumer/Londiste.

2007-04-10  -  SkyTools 2.1.3  -  "Brown Paper Bag"

    Still managed to sneak in a last-minute typo.

    * Fix copy-paste error in table_copy.py
    * Remember to bump version in pgq.version()

2007-04-09  -  SkyTools 2.1.2  -  "Help screen works"

    Most fallout from reorg is hopefully cleaned now.

    * Dumb bug in ticker wich made it almost non-working,
      except it managed to complete the regression test...
    * Move --skip-truncate switch from 'copy' to 'londiste add'.
    * 'londiste install' also installs plpgsql+plpythonu.
    * SQL installer logs full path to file it found.
    * Change pgq.get_queue_info() FOR loop variable to record
      instead text that was reported to fail, although it did work here.
    * Remember where the SQL files were installed.

2007-04-06  -  SkyTools 2.1.1  -  "Needs more thrust to fly"

    SkyTools got big reorg before release, but with the hoopla
    with the 3 projects at once, it did not get much testing...
    There are some untested areas still, but at least pgq/londiste
    are in better shape now.

    * pgqadm: finish conversion...
    * londiste.Syncer:
      - Convert to new API
      - Avoid ticking, parallel ticks are dangerous
      - Bad arg in repair
    * pgq:
      - too aggressive check in register_consumer
      - Algo desc for batch_event_sql
    * Add some knobs to make regtests for londiste pass
      more predictibly.

2007-03-13  -  SkyTools 2.1  -  "Radioactive Candy"

    * Final public release.
